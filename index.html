                <p>At the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, our students are driven to improve the 
                world around them. Through top academic programs in the arts, health, technology 
                and more, students develop in-demand skills and dive into cutting-edge research.
                They gain hands-on experience working with businesses and community organizations 
                in the city. As alumni, they use what they’ve learned to make our lives — and our 
                state — better.</p>
